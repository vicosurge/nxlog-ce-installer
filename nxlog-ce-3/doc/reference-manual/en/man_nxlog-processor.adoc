== NAME

nxlog-processor - performs batch log processing

== SYNOPSIS

*nxlog-processor* [-c _conffile_] [-v]

== DESCRIPTION

The nxlog-processor tool is similar to the NXLog daemon and uses the same
configuration file. However, it runs in the foreground and exits after all
input log data has been processed. Common input sources are files and
databases. This tool is useful for log processing tasks such as:

* loading a group of files into a database,
* converting between different formats,
* testing configuration, or
* doing offline event correlation.
