[desc="Directives and blocks available for configuring {productName}"]
== Configuration

An {productName} configuration consists of global directives, module
instances, and routes. The following sections list the core {productName}
directives provided. Additional directives are provided at the module level.
A valid configuration must contain at least one input module instance and at
least one output module instance.

A module instance name may contain letters, digits, periods (`.`), and
underscores (`pass:[_]`). The first character in a module instance name must
be a letter or an underscore. The corresponding regular expression is
`[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9._]*`.

A route instance name may contain letters, digits, periods (`.`), and
underscores (`pass:[_]`). The first character in a route instance name must be
a letter, a digit, or an underscore. The corresponding regular expression is
`[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9._]*`.

=== General Directives

The following directives can be used throughout the configuration
file. These directives are handled by the configuration parser, and
substitutions occur before the configuration check.

[[config_general_define]]
define:: Use this directive to configure a constant or macro to be
  used later. Refer to a `define` by surrounding the name with percent
  signs (`%`). Enclose a group of statements with curly braces (`{}`).
+
[[using_define]]
.Using the define Directive
====
This configuration shows three example defines: `BASEDIR` is a
constant, `IMPORTANT` is a statement, and `WARN_DROP` is a group of
statements.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/define.conf[lines=2..19]
----
====

[[config_general_include]]
include:: This directive allows a specified file to be included in the
  current configuration file. Wildcarded filenames are supported.
+
--
NOTE: The <<config_global_spooldir,SpoolDir>> directive only takes
      effect after the configuration is parsed, so relative paths
      specified with the *include* directive must be relative to the
      working directory {productName} was started from.

.Using the include Directive
====
This example includes a file relative to the directory {productName}
is started from:

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include modules/module1.conf
----

This example includes all matching files and uses an absolute path:

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include /etc/nxlog.d/*.conf

[[config_global]]
=== Global Directives

[[config_global_cachedir]]
CacheDir:: This directive specifies a directory where the cache file
  (`configcache.dat`) should be written. This directive has a
  compiled-in value which is used by default.

[[config_global_flowcontrol]]
FlowControl:: This optional boolean directive specifies whether all
  input and processor modules should use flow control. This defaults
  to TRUE. See the description of the module level
  <<config_module_flowcontrol,FlowControl>> directive for more
  information.

[[config_global_group]]
Group:: Similar to <<config_global_user,User>>, {productName} will set
  the group ID to run under. The group can be specified by name or
  numeric ID. This directive has no effect when running on the Windows
  platform or with <<nxlog-processor-8>>.

[[config_global_ignoreerrors]]
IgnoreErrors:: If set to FALSE, {productName} will stop when it
  encounters a problem with the configuration file (such as an invalid
  module directive) or if there is any other problem which would
  prevent all modules functioning correctly. If set to TRUE,
  {productName} will start after logging the problem. The default
  value is TRUE.

[[config_global_logfile]]
LogFile:: {productName} will write its internal log to this file. If
  this directive is not specified, self logging is disabled. Note that
  the <<im_internal,im_internal>> module can also be used to direct
  internal log messages to files or different output destinations, but
  this does not support log level below `INFO`. This *LogFile*
  directive is especially useful for debugging.

[[config_global_loglevel]]
LogLevel:: This directive has five possible values: `CRITICAL`,
  `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`. It will set both the
  logging level used for <<config_global_logfile,LogFile>> and the
  standard output if {productName} is started in the foreground. The
  default *LogLevel* is `INFO`.

[[config_global_moduledir]]
ModuleDir:: By default the {productName} binaries have a compiled-in
  value for the directory to search for loadable modules. This can be
  overridden with this directive. The module directory contains
  sub-directories for each module type (extension, input, output, and
  processor), and the module binaries are located in those.

[[config_global_nocache]]
NoCache:: Some modules save data to a cache file which is persisted
  across a shutdown/restart. Modules such as <<im_file,im_file>> will
  save the file position in order to continue reading from the same
  position after a restart as before. This caching mechanism can be
  explicitly turned off with this directive. This is mostly useful
  with <<nxlog-processor-8>> in offline mode. If
  this boolean directive is not specified, it defaults to FALSE
  (caching is enabled).
  Note that many input modules, such as _im_file_, provide a
  <<im_file_config_savepos,SavePos>> directive that can be used to disable the
  position cache for a specific module instance. **SavePos** has no effect if
  the cache is disabled globally with `NoCache TRUE`.

[[config_global_nofreeonexit]]
NoFreeOnExit:: This directive is for debugging. When set to TRUE,
  {productName} will not free module resources on exit, allowing
  valgrind to show proper stack trace locations in module function
  calls. The default value is FALSE.

[[config_global_panic]]
Panic:: A panic condition is a critical state which usually indicates
  a bug. Assertions are used in {productName} code for checking
  conditions where the code will not work unless the asserted
  condition is satisfied, and for security. Failing assertions result
  in a panic and suggest a bug in the code. A typical case is checking
  for NULL pointers before pointer dereference. This directive can
  take three different values: `HARD`, `SOFT`, or `OFF`. `HARD` will
  cause an abort in case the assertion fails. This is how most C based
  programs work. `SOFT` will cause an exception to be thrown at the
  place of the panic/assertion. In case of NULL pointer checks this is
  identical to a NullPointerException in Java. It is possible that
  {productName} can recover from exceptions and can continue to
  process log messages, or at least the other modules can. In case of
  assertion failure the location and the condition is printed at
  `CRITICAL` log level in `HARD` mode and `ERROR` log level in `SOFT`
  mode. If *Panic* is set to `OFF`, the failing condition is printed
  in the logs but the execution will continue on the normal code
  path. Most of the time this will result in a segmentation fault or
  other undefined behavior, though in some cases turning off a buggy
  assertion or panic will solve the problems caused by it in
  `HARD`/`SOFT` mode. The default value for *Panic* is `SOFT`.

[[config_global_pidfile]]
PidFile:: Under Unix operating systems, {productName} writes a PID
  file as other system daemons do. The default PID file can be
  overridden with this directive in case multiple daemon instances
  need to be running. This directive has no effect when running on the
  Windows platform or with <<nxlog-processor-8>>.

[[config_global_rootdir]]
RootDir:: {productName} will set its root directory to the value
  specified with this directive. If
  <<config_global_spooldir,SpoolDir>> is also set, this will be
  relative to the value of *RootDir* (chroot() is called first). This
  directive has no effect when running on the Windows platform or with
  the <<nxlog-processor-8>>.

[[config_global_spooldir]]
SpoolDir:: {productName} will change its working directory to the
  value specified with this directive. This is useful with files
  created through relative filenames (for example, with
  <<om_file,om_file>>) and in case of core dumps. This directive has
  no effect with the <<nxlog-processor-8>>.

[[config_global_suppressrepeatinglogs]]
SuppressRepeatingLogs:: Under some circumstances it is possible for
  {productName} to generate an extreme amount of internal logs
  consisting of the same message due to an incorrect configuration or a
  software bug. In this case, the <<config_global_logfile,LogFile>>
  can quickly consume the available disk space. With this directive,
  {productName} will write at most 2 lines per second if the same
  message is generated successively, by logging "last message repeated
  n times" messages. If this boolean directive is not specified, it
  defaults to TRUE (suppression of repeating messages is enabled).

[[config_global_threads]]
Threads:: This directive specifies the number of worker threads
  to use. The number of the worker threads is calculated and set to an
  optimal value if this directive is not defined. Do not set this
  unless you know what you are doing.

[[config_global_user]]
User:: {productName} will drop to the user specified with this
  directive. This is useful if {productName} needs privileged access
  to some system resources (such as kernel messages or to bind a port
  below 1024). On Linux systems {productName} will use capabilities to
  access these resources. In this case {productName} must be started
  as root. The user can be specified by name or numeric ID. This
  directive has no effect when running on the Windows platform or with
  <<nxlog-processor-8>>.

[[config_module_common]]
=== Common Module Directives

The following directives are common to all modules. The
<<config_module_module,Module>> directive is mandatory.

[[config_module_module]]
Module::
This mandatory directive specifies which binary should be
loaded. The module binary has a `.so` extension on Unix and a `.dll`
on Windows platforms and resides under the
<<config_global_moduledir,ModuleDir>> location. Each module binary
name is prefixed with `im_`, `pm_`, `om_`, or `xm_` (for _input_,
_processor_, _output_, and _extension_, respectively).
It is possible for multiple instances to use the same loadable
binary. In this case the binary is only loaded once but instantiated
multiple times. Different module instances may have different
configurations.

'''

[[config_module_flowcontrol]]
FlowControl::
+
--
This optional boolean directive specifies whether the module instance should
use flow control. *FlowControl* is only valid for Input and Processor
modules. By default,
*FlowControl* is TRUE (enabled). This module-level directive can be used to
override the global <<config_global_flowcontrol,FlowControl>> directive.

When flow control is in effect, a module (Input or Processor) which tries to
forward log data to the next module in the route will be suspended if the next
module cannot accept more data. For example, if a network module (such as
<<om_tcp,om_tcp>>) cannot forward logs because of a network error, the
preceding module in the route will be paused. When flow control is disabled,
the module will drop the log record if the queue of the next module in the
route is full.

Disabling flow control can be useful when multiple output modules are
configured to store or forward log data. When flow control is enabled, the
output modules will only process log data if all outputs are
functional. Consider the case where log data is stored in a file using
<<om_file,om_file>> and also forwarded over the network using
<<om_tcp,om_tcp>>. When flow control is enabled, a network disconnection will
make the data flow stall and log data will not be written into the local file
either. With flow control disabled, {productName} will write log data to the
file and will drop messages that cannot be forwarded over the network.

[WARNING]
Suspending an <<im_udp,im_udp>> instance is ineffective, because UDP provides
no receipt acknowledgement.
Suspending an <<im_uds,im_uds>> instance when collecting local Syslog messages
from the /dev/log Unix domain socket will cause the syslog() system call to
block in any programs trying to write to the system log.
It is generally recommended to disable flow control in these cases.
--

[[config_inputtype]]
InputType::
+
--
This directive specifies the name of the registered input reader function to
be used for parsing raw events from input data. Names are treated case
insensitively.  This directive is only available for stream oriented input
modules: <<im_file,im_file>>, <<im_exec,im_exec>>, <<im_ssl,im_ssl>>,
<<im_tcp,im_tcp>>, <<im_udp,im_udp>>, and <<im_uds,im_uds>>. These modules
work by filling an input buffer with data read from the source. If the read
operation was successful (there was data coming from the source), the module
calls the specified callback function. If this is not explicitly specified,
the module default will be used. Note that _im_udp_ may only work properly if
log messages do not span multiple packets and are within the UDP message size
limit. Otherwise the loss of a packet may lead to parsing errors.

Modules may provide custom input reader functions. Once these are registered
into the {productName} core, the modules listed above will be capable of using
these. This makes it easier to implement custom protocols because these can be
developed without concern for the transport layer.

The following input reader functions are provided by the {productName} core:

[[config_inputtype_binary]]
Binary:: The input is parsed in the {productName} binary format, which
  preserves the parsed fields of the event records. The
  <<config_inputtype_linebased,LineBased>> reader will automatically
  detect event records in the binary {productName} format, so it is
  only recommended to configure InputType to *Binary* if compatibility
  with other logging software is not required.

[[config_inputtype_dgram]]
Dgram:: Once the buffer is filled with data, it is considered to be
  one event record. This is the default for the <<im_udp,im_udp>>
  input module, since UDP Syslog messages arrive in separate packets.

[[config_inputtype_linebased]]
LineBased:: The input is assumed to contain event records separated by
  newlines. It can handle both CRLF (Windows) and LF (Unix)
  line-breaks. Thus if an LF (`\n`) or CRLF (`\r\n`) is found, the
  function assumes that it has reached the end of the event record.

.TCP Input Assuming {productName} Format

This configuration explicitly specifies the <<config_inputtype_binary,Binary>>
InputType.

--

[[config_outputtype]]
OutputType::
+
--
This directive specifies the name of the registered output writer function to
be used for formatting raw events when storing or forwarding output. Names are
treated case insensitively. This directive is only available for stream
oriented output modules: <<om_file,om_file>>, <<om_exec,om_exec>>,
<<om_ssl,om_ssl>>, <<om_tcp,om_tcp>>, <<om_udp,om_udp>>, and
<<om_uds,om_uds>>. These modules work by filling the output buffer with data
to be written to the destination. The specified callback function is called
before the write operation. If this is not explicitly specified, the module
default will be used.

Modules may provide custom output formatter functions. Once these are
registered into the {productName} core, the modules listed above will
be capable of using these. This makes it easier to implement custom
protocols because these can be developed without concern for the
transport layer.

The following output writer functions are provided by the {productName} core:

[[config_outputtype_binary]]
Binary:: The output is written in the {productName} binary format
  which preserves parsed fields of the event records.

[[config_outputtype_dgram]]
Dgram:: Once the buffer is filled with data, it is considered to be
  one event record. This is the default for the <<om_udp,om_udp>>
  output module, since UDP Syslog messages are sent in separate
  packets.

[[config_outputtype_linebased]]
LineBased:: The output will contain event records separated by
  newlines. The record terminator is CRLF (`\r\n`).

.TCP Output Sending Messages in {productName} Format
====
This configuration explicitly specifies the
<<config_outputtype_binary,Binary>> OutputType.

[[config_module_exec]]
==== Exec

The *Exec* directive/block contains <<lang_statements,statements>> in
the <<ref-lang,{productName} language>> which are executed when a module
receives a log message. This directive is available in all
<<input-modules,input>>, <<processor-modules,processor>>, and
<<output-modules,output>> modules.  It is not available in most
<<extension-modules,extension>> modules because these do not handle
log messages directly (the <<xm_multiline,xm_multiline>> and
<<xm_rewrite,xm_rewrite>> modules do provide *Exec* directives).

.Simple Exec Statement
====
This statement assigns a value to the `$Hostname` field in the event
record.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/exec.conf[lines=4]
----
====

Each directive must be on one line unless it contains a trailing
backslash (`\`) character.

[[exec-statement-spanning-multiple-lines]]
.Exec Statement Spanning Multiple Lines
====
This <<lang_statement_if,if>> statement uses line continuation to span
multiple lines.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/exec.conf[lines=6..9]
----
====

More than one *Exec* directive or block may be specified. They are
executed in the order of appearance. Each *Exec* directive must
contain a full statement. Therefore it is not possible to split the
lines in the previous example into multiple *Exec* directives. It is
only possible to split the *Exec* directive if it contains multiple
statements.

.Equivalent Use of Statements in Exec
====
This example shows two equivalent uses of the *Exec* directive.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/exec.conf[lines=11..12]
----

This produces identical behavior:

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/exec.conf[lines=14..15]
----
====

The *Exec* directive can also be used as a block. To use multiple
statements spanning more than one line, it is recommended to use the
`<Exec>` block instead. When using a block, it is not necessary to use
the backslash (`\`) character for line continuation.

.Using the Exec Block
====
This example shows two equivalent uses of *Exec*, first as a
_directive_, then as a _block_.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]

The following *Exec* _block_ is equivalent. Notice the backslash (`\`)
is omitted.

[[config_module_schedule]]
==== Schedule

The Schedule block can be used to execute periodic jobs, such as log
rotation or any other task. Scheduled jobs have the same priority as
the module. The Schedule block has the following directives:

[[config_module_schedule_every]]
Every:: In addition to the crontab format it is possible to schedule
  execution at periodic intervals. With the crontab format it is not
  possible to run a job every five days for example, but this
  directive enables it in a simple way. It takes an integer value with
  an optional unit. The unit can be one of the following: `sec`,
  `min`, `hour`, `day`, or `week`. If the unit is not specified, the
  value is assumed to be in seconds.

[[config_module_schedule_exec]]
Exec:: The mandatory *Exec* directive takes one or more {productName}
  <<lang_statements,statements>>. This is the code which is actually
  being scheduled. Multiple *Exec* directives can be specified within
  one *Schedule* block. See the module-level
  <<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive, this behaves the same. Note
  that it is not possible to use <<lang_fields,fields>> in statements
  here because execution is not triggered by log messages.

[[config_module_schedule_first]]
First:: This directive sets the first execution time. If the value is
  in the past, the next execution time is calculated as if
  {productName} has been running since and jobs will not be run to
  make up for missed events in the past. The directive takes a
  <<lang_literal_datetime,datetime>> literal value.

[[config_module_schedule_when]]
When:: This directive takes a value similar to a crontab entry: five
  space-separated definitions for minute, hour, day, month, and
  weekday. See the crontab(5) manual for the field definitions. It
  supports lists as comma separated values and/or ranges. Step values
  are also supported with the slash. Month and week days are not
  supported, these must be defined with numeric values. The following
  extensions are also supported:
+
----
@yearly        Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
@annually      (same as @yearly)
@monthly       Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
@weekly        Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
@daily         Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
@midnight      (same as @daily)
@hourly        Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".
----

.Scheduled Exec Statements
====
This example shows two scheduled <<config_module_schedule_exec,Exec>>
statements in a <<im_tcp,im_tcp>> module instance. The first is
executed every second, while the second uses a crontab(5) style value.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]

=== Route Directives

The following directives can be used in Route blocks. The
<<config_route_path,Path>> directive is mandatory.

[[config_route_path]]
Path::
+
--
The data flow is defined by the *Path* directive. First the instance names of
Input modules are specified. If more than one Input reads log messages which
feed data into the route, then these must be separated by commas. The list of
Input modules is followed by an arrow (`\=>`). Either processor modules or
output modules follow. Processor modules must be separated by arrows, not
commas, because they operate in series, unlike Input and Output modules which
work in parallel. Output modules are separated by commas. The *Path* must
specify at least an Input and an Output. The syntax is illustrated by the
following:

`Path INPUT1[, INPUT2\...] \=> [PROCESSOR1 [\=> PROCESSOR2\...] \=>]
OUTPUT1[, OUTPUT2\...]`

[[config_example_routes]]
.Specifying Routes
====
The following configuration shows modules being used in three
different routes.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../config-examples/routes.conf[tags=manual_include]
----
====
--

'''

[[config_route_priority,Priority]]
Priority::
+
--
This directive takes an integer value in the range of 1-100 as a parameter,
and the default is `10`. Log messages in routes with a lower *Priority* value
will be processed before others. Internally, this value is assigned to each
module part of the route. The events of the modules are processed in priority
order by the {productName} engine. Modules of a route with a lower *Priority*
value (higher priority) will process log messages first.

.Prioritized Processing
====
This configuration prioritizes the UDP route over the TCP route in order to
minimize loss of UDP Syslog messages when the system is busy.
