=== Extension Modules

Extension modules do not process log messages directly, and for this
reason their instances cannot be part of a route.
These modules enhance the features of {productName} in various ways,
such as exporting new functions and procedures or registering
additional I/O reader and writer functions (to be used with modules
supporting the <<config_inputtype,InputType>> and
<<config_outputtype,OutputType>> directives). There are many ways to
hook an extension module into the {productName} engine, as the
following modules illustrate.

=== Input Modules

Input modules are responsible for collecting event log data from
various sources.

Each module provides a set of fields for each log message, these are
documented in the corresponding sections below. The {productName} core
will add to this set the fields listed in the following section.
