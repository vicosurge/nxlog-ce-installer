[[om_file_funcs]]
===== Functions

The following functions are exported by _om_file_.

[[om_file_func_file_name]]
<<lang_type_string,string>> `file_name()`::
+
--

Return the name of the currently open file which was specified using
the <<om_file_config_file,File>> directive.  Note that
this will be the old name if the filename changes dynamically; for the
new name, use the expression specified for the
<<om_file_config_file,File>> directive instead of using
this function.
     
--

[[om_file_func_file_size]]
<<lang_type_integer,integer>> `file_size()`::
+
--

Return the size of the currently open output file in bytes. Returns
undef if the file is not open. This can happen if
<<om_file_config_file,File>> is not a string literal
expression and there was no log message.
     
--


[[om_file_procs]]
===== Procedures

The following procedures are exported by _om_file_.

[[om_file_proc_reopen]]
`reopen();`::
+
--

Reopen the current file. This procedure should be called if the file
has been removed or renamed, for example with the
<<xm_fileop_proc_file_cycle,file_cycle()>>,
<<xm_fileop_proc_file_remove,file_remove()>>, or
<<xm_fileop_proc_file_rename,file_rename()>> procedures of
the xm_fileop module. This does not need to be called after
<<om_file_proc_rotate_to,rotate_to()>> because that
procedure reopens the file automatically.
     
--

[[om_file_proc_rotate_to]]
`rotate_to(<<lang_type_string,string>> filename);`::
+
--

Rotate the current file to the _filename_ specified. The module will
then open the original file specified with the
<<om_file_config_file,File>> directive. Note that the
rename(2) system call is used internally which does not support moving
files across different devices on some platforms. If this is a
problem, first rotate the file on the same device. Then use the
xm_exec <<xm_exec_proc_exec_async,exec_async()>> procedure
to copy it to another device or file system, or use the xm_fileop
<<xm_fileop_proc_file_copy,file_copy()>> procedure.
