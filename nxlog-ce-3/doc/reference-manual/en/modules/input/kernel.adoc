[desc="Reads messages from the kernel log buffer on Linux, BSD, or macOS"]
==== Kernel (im_kernel)

This module can collect kernel log messages from the kernel log
buffer. Currently this module works on Linux
only, where the klogctl()
system call is used for this purpose. In order to be able to read
kernel logs, special privileges are required. For this, {productName}
needs to be started as root. Using the <<config_global_user,User>> and
<<config_global_group,Group>> global directives {productName} can then
drop its root privileges while keeping the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
order to read the kernel log buffer.

NOTE: Unfortunately it is not possible to read from the /proc/kmsg
      pseudo file for an unprivileged process even if the
      CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability is kept. For this reason the /proc/kmsg
      interface is not supported by the _im_kernel_ module. The
      <<im_file,im_file>> module should work fine with the /proc/kmsg
      pseudo file if one wishes to collect kernel logs this way,
      though this will require {productName} to be running as root.

.Log Sample
[source,log]
----
<6>Some message from the kernel.
----

Kernel messages are valid BSD Syslog messages, with a priority from 0 (emerg)
to 7 (debug), but do not contain timestamp and hostname fields. These can be
parsed with the _xm_syslog_
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_bsd,parse_syslog_bsd()>> procedure, and the
timestamp and hostname fields will be added by {productName}.
