[desc="Collects log data from an external database with the libdbi library"]
==== DBI (im_dbi)

The _im_dbi_ module allows {productName} to pull log data from external
databases. This module utilizes the
http://libdbi.sourceforge.net[libdbi] database abstraction library,
which supports various database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,
MSSQL, Sybase, Oracle, SQLite, and Firebird. A SELECT statement can be
specified, which will be executed periodically to check for new
records.

NOTE: The _im_dbi_ and <<om_dbi,om_dbi>> modules support GNU/Linux only
      because of the libdbi library. The _im_odbc_ and
      _om_odbc_ modules provide native database access on
      Windows (NXLog EE only).

// tag::driver-pkgs[]

NOTE: libdbi needs <<im_dbi_config_driver,drivers>> to access the
      database engines. These are in the libdbd-* packages on Debian
      and Ubuntu. CentOS 5.6 has a libdbi-drivers RPM package, but
      this package does not contain any driver binaries under
      /usr/lib64/dbd. The drivers for both MySQL and PostgreSQL are in
      libdbi-dbd-mysql. If these are not installed, {productName} will
      return a libdbi driver initialization error.

[[im_dbi_config]]
===== Configuration

The _im_dbi_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[im_dbi_config_driver]]

// tag::driver[]

Driver:: This mandatory directive specifies the name of the libdbi
  driver which will be used to connect to the database. A DRIVER name
  must be provided here for which a loadable driver module exists
  under the name `libdbdDRIVER.so` (usually under `/usr/lib/dbd/`). The
  MySQL driver is in the `libdbdmysql.so` file.

// end::driver[]

[[im_dbi_config_sql]]
SQL:: This directive should specify the SELECT statement to be
  executed every <<im_dbi_config_pollinterval,PollInterval>>
  seconds. The module automatically appends a `WHERE id > ? LIMIT 10`
  clause to the statement. The result set returned by the SELECT
  statement must contain an _id_ column which is then stored and used
  for the next query.

'''

[[im_dbi_config_option]]

// tag::option[]

Option:: This directive can be used to specify additional driver
  options such as connection parameters. The manual of the libdbi
  driver should contain the options available for use here.

// end::option[]

[[im_dbi_config_pollinterval]]
PollInterval:: This directive specifies how frequently the module will
  check for new records, in seconds. If this directive is not
  specified, the default is 1 second. Fractional seconds may be
  specified (`PollInterval 0.5` will check twice every second).

[[im_dbi_config_savepos]]
SavePos:: If this boolean directive is set to TRUE, the position will
  be saved when {productName} exits. The position will be read from
  the cache file upon startup. The default is TRUE: the position will
  be saved if this directive is not specified. Even if *SavePos* is
  enabled, it can be explicitly turned off with the global
  <<config_global_nocache,NoCache>> directive.
