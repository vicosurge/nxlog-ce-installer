[desc="Accepts log data over TCP connections"]
==== TCP (im_tcp)

This module accepts TCP connections on the configured address and
port. It can handle multiple simultaneous connections. The TCP
transfer protocol provides more reliable log transmission than UDP.
If security is a concern, consider using the <<im_ssl,im_ssl>> module
instead.

NOTE: This module provides no access control. Firewall rules can be
      used to deny connections from certain hosts.

[[im_tcp_config]]
===== Configuration

The _im_tcp_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[im_tcp_config_host]]
Host:: The module will accept connections on this IP address or DNS
  hostname. For security, the default listen address is `localhost` (the
  _localhost_ loopback address is not accessible from the outside). To receive
  logs from remote hosts, the address specified here must be accessible. The
  _any_ address `0.0.0.0` is commonly used here.

[[im_tcp_config_port]]
Port:: The module will listen for incoming connections on this port
  number. The default port is 514 if this directive is not specified.
