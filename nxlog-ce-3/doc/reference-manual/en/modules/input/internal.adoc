[desc="Provides {productName}'s internal logs as an input source"]
==== Internal (im_internal)

{productName} produces its own logs about its operations, including
errors and debug messages. This module makes it possible to insert
those internal log messages into a route. Internal messages can also
be generated from the {productName} language using the
<<core_proc_log_info,log_info()>>,
<<core_proc_log_warning,log_warning()>>, and
<<core_proc_log_error,log_error()>> procedures.

NOTE: Only messages with log level INFO and above are supported. Debug
      messages are ignored due to technical reasons. For debugging
      purposes the direct logging facility should be used: see the
      global <<config_global_logfile,LogFile>> and
      <<config_global_loglevel,LogLevel>> directives.

WARNING: One must be careful about the use of the _im_internal_ module
         because it is easy to cause message loops. For example,
         consider the situation when internal log messages are sent to
         a database. If the database is experiencing errors which
         result in internal error messages, then these are again
         routed to the database and this will trigger further error
         messages, resulting in a loop. In order to avoid a resource
         exhaustion, the _im_internal_ module will drop its messages
         when the queue of the next module in the route is full. It is
         recommended to always put the _im_internal_ module instance in
         a separate route.

NOTE: If internal messages are required in Syslog format, they must be
      explicitly converted with <<pm_transformer,pm_transformer>> or
      the <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_bsd,to_syslog_bsd()>> procedure
      of the <<xm_syslog,xm_syslog>> module, because the
      <<im_internal_field_raw_event,$raw_event>> field is not
      generated in Syslog format.
