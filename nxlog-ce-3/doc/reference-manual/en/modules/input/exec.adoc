[[im_exec]]
[desc="Executes a program or script and reads log data from standard output"]
==== External Programs (im_exec)

This module will execute a program or script on startup and read its
standard output. It can be used to easily integrate with exotic log
sources which can be read only with the help of an external script or
program.

WARNING: If you are using a Perl script, consider
         turning on _Autoflush_ with `$| = 1;`, otherwise _im_exec_
         might not receive data immediately due to Perl's internal
         buffering. See the http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html[Perl language
         reference] for more information about `$|`.

[[im_exec_config]]
===== Configuration

The _im_exec_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>. The
<<im_exec_config_command,Command>> directive is required.

[[im_exec_config_command]]
Command:: This mandatory directive specifies the name of the program or script
  to be executed.

'''

[[im_exec_config_arg]]
Arg:: This is an optional parameter. *Arg* can be specified multiple
  times, once for each argument that needs to be passed to the
  <<im_exec_config_command,Command>>. Note that specifying multiple
  arguments with one *Arg* directive, with arguments separated by
  spaces, will not work (the <<im_exec_config_command,Command>> would
  receive it as one argument).

[[im_exec_config_inputtype]]
InputType:: See the <<config_inputtype,InputType>> description in the
  global module configuration section.

[[im_exec_config_restart]]
Restart:: Restart the process if it exits. There is a one second delay
  before it is restarted to avoid a denial-of-service when a process
  is not behaving. Looping should be implemented in the script itself,
  this directive is only to provide some safety against malfunctioning
  scripts and programs. This boolean directive defaults to FALSE: the
  <<im_exec_config_command,Command>> will not be restarted if it
  exits.

[[im_exec_config_examples]]
===== Examples

.Emulating im_file
====
This configuration uses the tail command to read from a file.

NOTE: The <<im_file,im_file>> module should be used to read log
      messages from files. This example only demonstrates the use of
      the _im_exec_ module.
