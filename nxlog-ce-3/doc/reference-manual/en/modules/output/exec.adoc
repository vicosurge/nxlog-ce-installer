:module: om_exec
[[om_exec]]
[desc="Executes a program or script and writes log data to standard input"]
==== Program (om_exec)

This module will execute a program or script on startup and write
(pipe) log data to its standard input. Unless
<<config_outputtype,OutputType>> is set to something else,
only the contents of the `$raw_event` field are sent over the
pipe. The execution of the program or script will terminate when the
module is stopped, which usually happens when {ProductName} exits and
the pipe is closed.

NOTE: The program or script is started when {productName} starts and
      must not exit until the module is stopped. To invoke a program
      or script for each log message, use <<xm_exec,xm_exec>> instead.

[[om_exec_config]]
===== Configuration

The _om_exec_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.
The <<om_exec_config_command,Command>> directive is required.

[[om_exec_config_command]]
Command:: This mandatory directive specifies the name of the
  program or script to be executed.

'''

[[om_exec_config_arg]]
Arg:: This is an optional parameter. *Arg* can be specified
  multiple times, once for each argument that needs to be passed to
  the <<om_exec_config_command,Command>>. Note that specifying
  multiple arguments with one *Arg* directive, with arguments
  separated by spaces, will not work (the
  <<om_exec_config_command,Command>> will receive it as one argument).

[[om_exec_config_examples]]
===== Examples

.Piping Logs to an External Program
====
With this configuration, {productName} will start the specified
command, read logs from socket, and write those logs to the standard
input of the command.
