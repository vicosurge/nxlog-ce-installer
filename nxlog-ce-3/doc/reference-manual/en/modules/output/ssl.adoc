[desc="Sends log data over SSL/TLS-secured connections"]
==== TLS/SSL (om_ssl)

The _om_ssl_ module uses the OpenSSL library to provide an SSL/TLS
transport. It behaves like the <<om_tcp,om_tcp>> module, except that
an SSL handshake is performed at connection time and the data is
received over a secure channel. Log messages transferred over plain
TCP can be eavesdropped or even altered with a man-in-the-middle
attack, while the _om_ssl_ module provides a secure log message
transport.

[[om_ssl_config]]
===== Configuration

The _om_ssl_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.
The <<om_ssl_config_host,Host>> directive is required.

[[om_ssl_config_host]]
Host:: The module will connect to this IP address or DNS hostname.

[[om_ssl_config_port]]
Port:: The module will connect to this port number on the remote host.
  The default is port 514.

'''

[[om_ssl_config_allowuntrusted]]
AllowUntrusted:: This boolean directive specifies that the connection
  should be allowed without certificate verification. If set to TRUE
  the connection will be allowed even if the remote server presents an
  unknown or self-signed certificate. The default value is FALSE: the
  remote socket must present a trusted certificate.

[[om_ssl_config_cadir]]
CADir:: This specifies the path to a directory containing certificate
  authority (CA) certificates, which will be used to check the
  certificate of the remote socket. The certificate filenames in this
  directory must be in the OpenSSL hashed format.

[[om_ssl_config_cafile]]
CAFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate authority (CA)
  certificate, which will be used to check the certificate of the
  remote socket.

[[om_ssl_config_certfile]]
CertFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate file to be used
  for the SSL handshake.

[[om_ssl_config_certkeyfile]]
CertKeyFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate key file to
  be used for the SSL handshake.

[[om_ssl_config_crldir]]
CRLDir:: This specifies the path to a directory containing certificate
  revocation lists (CRLs), which will be consulted when checking the
  certificate of the remote socket. The certificate filenames in this
  directory must be in the OpenSSL hashed format.

[[om_ssl_config_crlfile]]
CRLFile::
  This specifies the path of the certificate revocation list (CRL) which
  will be used to check the certificate of the remote socket against.

[[om_ssl_config_keypass]]
KeyPass:: With this directive, a password can be supplied for the
  certificate key file defined in
  <<om_ssl_config_certkeyfile,CertKeyFile>>. This directive is not
  needed for passwordless private keys.

[[om_ssl_config_outputtype]]
OutputType:: See the <<config_outputtype,OutputType>> directive in the
  list of common module directives.

[[om_ssl_config_reconnect]]
Reconnect:: This directive has been deprecated as of version 2.4. The
  module will try to reconnect automatically at increasing intervals
  on all errors.

===== Examples

.Sending Binary Data to Another {productName} Agent
====
This configuration reads log messages from socket and sends them in
the {productName} <<config_outputtype_binary,binary>> format to
another {productName} agent.
