:module: om_http
[[om_http]]
[desc="Sends log messages via HTTP or HTTPS connections"]
==== HTTP(s) (om_http)

This module will connect to the specified <<om_http_config_url,URL>>
in either plain HTTP or HTTPS mode. Each event is transferred in a
single POST request. The module then waits for a response containing a
successful status code (200, 201, or 202). It will reconnect and retry
the delivery if the remote has closed the connection or a timeout is
exceeded while waiting for the response. This HTTP-level
acknowledgment ensures that no messages are lost during transfer.

[[om_http_config]]
===== Configuration

The _om_http_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.
The <<om_http_config_url,URL>> directive is required.

[[om_http_config_url]]
URL:: This mandatory directive specifies the URL where the module
  should POST the event data. The module operates in plain HTTP or
  HTTPS mode depending on the URL provided, and connects to the
  hostname specified in the URL. If the port number is not explicitly
  indicated in the URL, it defaults to port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for
  HTTPS.

'''

[[om_http_config_contenttype]]
ContentType:: This directive sets the _Content-Type_ HTTP header to
  the string specified. The _Content-Type_ is set to `text/plain` by
  default.

[[om_http_config_httpsallowuntrusted]]
HTTPSAllowUntrusted:: This boolean directive specifies that the
  connection should be allowed without certificate verification. If
  set to TRUE, the connection will be allowed even if the remote HTTPS
  server presents an unknown or self-signed certificate. The default
  value is FALSE: the remote HTTPS server must present a trusted
  certificate.

[[om_http_config_httpscadir]]
HTTPSCADir:: This specifies the path to a directory containing
  certificate authority (CA) certificates, which will be used to check
  the certificate of the remote HTTPS server. The certificate
  filenames in this directory must be in the OpenSSL hashed format.

[[om_http_config_httpscafile]]
HTTPSCAFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate authority
  (CA) certificate, which will be used to check the certificate of the
  remote HTTPS server.

[[om_http_config_httpscertfile]]
HTTPSCertFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate file to be
  used for the HTTPS handshake.

[[om_http_config_httpscertkeyfile]]
HTTPSCertKeyFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate key file
  to be used for the HTTPS handshake.

[[om_http_config_httpscrldir]]
HTTPSCRLDir:: This specifies the path to a directory containing
  certificate revocation lists (CRLs), which will be consulted when
  checking the certificate of the remote HTTPS server. The certificate
  filenames in this directory must be in the OpenSSL hashed format.

[[om_http_config_httpscrlfile]]
HTTPSCRLFile:: This specifies the path of the certificate revocation
  list (CRL) which will be consulted when checking the certificate of
  the remote HTTPS server.

[[om_http_config_httpskeypass]]
HTTPSKeyPass:: With this directive, a password can be supplied for the
  certificate key file defined in
  <<om_http_config_httpscertkeyfile,HTTPSCertKeyFile>>. This directive
  is not needed for passwordless private keys.
