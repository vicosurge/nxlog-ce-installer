:module: om_tcp
[[om_tcp]]
[desc="Sends log data over TCP connections"]
==== TCP (om_tcp)

This module initiates a TCP connection to a remote host and transfers
log messages.
Or, in <<om_tcp_config_listen,Listen>> mode, this module accepts
client connections and multiplexes data to all connected clients.
The TCP transfer protocol provides more reliable log
transmission than UDP. If security is a concern, consider using the
<<om_ssl,om_ssl>> module instead.

[[om_tcp_config]]
===== Configuration

The _om_tcp_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.
The <<om_tcp_config_host,Host>> directive is required.

[[om_tcp_config_host]]
Host:: The module will connect to this IP address or DNS hostname.
  Or, if <<om_tcp_config_listen,Listen>> is set to TRUE, the module will
  listen for connections on this address.

[[om_tcp_config_port]]
Port:: The module will connect to this port number on the remote
  host.
  Or, if <<om_tcp_config_listen,Listen>> is set to TRUE, the module will
  listen for connections on this port.
  The default is port 514.

'''

[[om_tcp_config_listen]]
Listen:: If TRUE, this boolean directive specifies that _om_tcp_ should listen
  for connections at the local address specified by the
  <<om_tcp_config_host,Host>> directive rather than opening a connection to
  the address. The default is FALSE: _om_tcp_ will connect to the specified
  address.

[[om_tcp_config_outputtype]]
OutputType:: See the <<config_outputtype,OutputType>> directive in the
  list of common module directives.

[[om_tcp_config_queueinlistenmode]]
QueueInListenMode:: If set to TRUE, this boolean directive specifies that
  events should be queued if no client is connected. If this module's buffer
  becomes full, the preceding module in the route will be paused or events
  will be dropped, depending on whether
  <<config_module_flowcontrol,FlowControl>> is enabled. This directive only
  applies if <<om_tcp_config_listen,Listen>> is set to TRUE. The default is
  FALSE: _om_tcp_ will discard events if no client is connected.

[[om_tcp_config_reconnect]]
Reconnect:: This directive has been deprecated as of version 2.4. The
  module will try to reconnect automatically at increasing intervals
  on all errors.
