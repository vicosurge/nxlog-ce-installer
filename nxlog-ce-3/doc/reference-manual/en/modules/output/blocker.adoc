[desc="Blocks log processing for testing purposes"]
==== Blocker (om_blocker)

This module is mostly for testing purposes. It will block log messages
in order to simulate a blocked route, like when a network transport
output module such as <<om_tcp,om_tcp>> blocks because of a network
problem.

The <<core_proc_sleep,sleep()>> procedure can also be used for testing
by simulating log message delays.

behavior of the configured memory-based buffer.
