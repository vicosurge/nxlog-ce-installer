==== Files (om_file)

This module can be used to write log messages to a file.

[[om_file_config]]
===== Configuration

The _om_file_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.
The <<om_file_config_file,File>> directive is required.

[[om_file_config_file]]
File:: This mandatory directive specifies the name of the output file
  to open. It must be a <<lang_type_string,string>> type
  <<lang_expressions,expression>>. If the expression in the *File*
  directive is not a constant string (it contains functions, field
  names, or operators), it will be evaluated before each event is
  written to the file (and after the <<config_module_exec,Exec>> is
  evaluated).  Note that the filename must be quoted to be a valid
  string literal, unlike in other directives which take a filename
  argument. For relative filenames, note that {productName} changes
  its working directory to "/" unless the global
  <<config_global_spooldir,SpoolDir>> is set to something else.
+
Below are three variations for specifying the same output file on a
Windows system:

File 'C:\logs\logmsg.txt'
File "C:\\logs\\logmsg.txt"
File 'C:/logs/logmsg.txt'

'''

[[om_file_config_createdir]]
CreateDir:: If set to TRUE, this optional boolean directive instructs
  the module to create the output directory before opening the file
  for writing if it does not exist. The default is FALSE.

[[om_file_config_outputtype]]
OutputType:: See the <<config_outputtype,OutputType>> directive in the
  list of common module directives. If this directive is not specified
  the default is <<config_outputtype_linebased,LineBased>>.

[[om_file_config_sync]]
Sync:: This optional boolean directive instructs the module to sync
  the file after each log message is written, ensuring that it is
  really written to disk from the buffers. Because this can hurt
  performance, the default is FALSE.

[[om_file_config_truncate]]
Truncate:: This optional boolean directive instructs the module to
  truncate the file before each write, causing only the most recent
  log message to be saved. The default is FALSE: messages are appended
  to the output file.

[[om_file_config_examples]]
===== Examples

.Storing Raw Syslog Messages into a File
====
This configuration reads log messages from socket and writes the
messages to file. No additional processing is done.

[[om_file_config_example_rotate1]]
.File Rotation Based on Size
====
With this configuration, {productName} accepts log messages via TCP
and parses them as BSD Syslog. A separate output file is used for log
messages from each host. When the output file size exceeds 15 MB, it
will be automatically rotated and compressed.
