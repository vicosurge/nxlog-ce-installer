[desc="Allows log processing to be paused and resumed"]
==== Blocker (pm_blocker)

This module blocks log messages and can be used to simulate a blocked
route. When the module blocks the data flow, log messages are first
accumulated in the buffers, and then the flow control mechanism pauses
the input modules. Using the <<pm_blocker_proc_block,block()>>
procedure, it is possible to programmatically stop or resume the data
flow. It can be useful for real-world scenarios as well as
testing. See the examples below. When the module starts, the blocking
mode is disabled by default (it operates like <<pm_null,pm_null>>
would).

====
In this example messages are received over UDP and forwarded to
another host via TCP. The log data is forwarded during non-working
hours (between 7pm and 8am). During working hours, the data is
buffered on the disk.
