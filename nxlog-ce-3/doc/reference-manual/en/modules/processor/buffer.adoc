[desc="Implements disk- and memory-based buffering for log data"]
==== Buffer (pm_buffer)

Messages received over UDP may be dropped by the operating system if
packets are not read from the message buffer fast enough. Some logging
subsystems using a small circular buffer can overwrite old logs in the
buffer if it is not read, also resulting in loss of log
data. Buffering can help in such situations.

The _pm_buffer_ module supports disk- and memory-based log message
buffering. If both are required, multiple _pm_buffer_ instances can be
used with different settings. Because a memory buffer can be faster,
though its size is limited, combining memory and disk based buffering
can be a good idea if buffering is frequently used.

The disk-based buffering mode stores the log message data in chunks.
When all the data is successfully forwarded from a chunk, it is then
deleted in order to save disk space.

NOTE: Using _pm_buffer_ is only recommended when there is a chance of
      message loss. The built-in flow control in {productName} ensures
      that messages will not be read by the input module until the
      output side can send, store, or forward. When reading from files
      (with <<im_file,im_file>>) or the Windows EventLog (with
      <<im_mseventlog,im_mseventlog>> or
      <<im_msvistalog,im_msvistalog>>) it is rarely necessary to use
      the _pm_buffer_ module unless log rotation is used. During a
      rotation, there is a possibility of dropping some data while the
      output module (<<im_tcp,im_tcp>>, for example) is being blocked.

[[pm_buffer_config]]
===== Configuration

The _pm_buffer_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.  The
<<pm_buffer_config_maxsize,MaxSize>> and <<pm_buffer_config_type,Type>>
directives are required.

[[pm_buffer_config_maxsize]]
MaxSize:: This mandatory directive specifies the size of the buffer in
  kilobytes.

[[pm_buffer_config_type]]
Type:: This directive can be set to either `Mem` or `Disk` to select
  memory- or disk-based buffering.

'''

[[pm_buffer_config_directory]]
Directory:: This directory will be used to store the disk buffer file
  chunks. This is only valid if <<pm_buffer_config_type,Type>> is set
  to `Disk`.

[[pm_buffer_config_warnlimit]]
WarnLimit:: This directive specifies an optional limit, smaller than
  <<pm_buffer_config_maxsize,MaxSize>>, which will trigger a warning
  message when reached. The log message will not be generated again
  until the buffer size drops to half of *WarnLimit* and reaches it
  again in order to protect against a warning message flood.

[[pm_buffer_config_examples]]
===== Examples

.Using a Memory Buffer to Protect Against UDP Message Loss
====
This configuration accepts log messages via UDP and forwards them
via TCP. An intermediate memory-based buffer allows the
<<im_udp,im_udp>> module instance to continue accepting messages even
if the <<om_tcp,om_tcp>> output stops working (caused by downtime of
the remote host or network issues, for example).
