[desc="Discards duplicate events and adds \"last message repeated n times\""]
==== De-Duplicator (pm_norepeat)

This module can be used to filter out repeating messages. Like Syslog
daemons, this module checks the previous message against the
current. If they match, the current message is dropped. The module
waits one second for duplicated messages to arrive. If duplicates are
detected, the first message is forwarded, the rest are dropped, and a
message containing "last message repeated n times" is sent instead.

[[pm_norepeat_config]]
===== Configuration

The _pm_norepeat_ module accepts the following directives in addition to
the <<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[pm_norepeat_config_checkfields]]
CheckFields:: This optional directive takes a comma-separated list of
  field names which are used to compare log messages. Only the fields
  listed here are compared, the others are ignored. For example, the
  `$EventTime` field will be different in repeating messages, so this
  field should not be used in the comparison. If this directive is not
  specified, the default field to be checked is `$Message`.

.Filtering Out Duplicated Messages
====
This configuration reads log messages from the socket. The
`$Hostname`, `$SourceName`, and `$Message` fields are used to detect
duplicates. Then the messages are written to file.
