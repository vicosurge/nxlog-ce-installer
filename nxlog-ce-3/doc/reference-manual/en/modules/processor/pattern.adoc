[desc="Performs efficient pattern matching with an XML pattern database file"]
==== Pattern Matcher (pm_pattern)

This module makes it possible to execute pattern matching with a
pattern database file in XML format. Using this module is more
efficient than having {productName} regular expression rules listed in
<<config_module_exec,Exec>> directives, because the _pm_pattern_ module
was designed in such a way that patterns do not need to be matched
linearly. In addition, the module does an automatic on-the-fly pattern
reordering internally for further speed improvements and has a feature
which can be used to tag messages with additional fields useful for
message classification.

There are other techniques such as the radix tree which solve the
linearity problem; the drawback is that usually these require the user
to learn a special syntax for specifying patterns. If the log message
is already parsed and is not treated as single line of message, then
it is possible to process only a subset of the patterns which
partially solves the linearity problem. With other performance
improvements employed within the _pm_pattern_ module, its speed can
compare to the other techniques. Yet the _pm_pattern_ module uses
regular expressions which are familiar to users and can easily be
migrated from other tools.

Traditionally, pattern matching on log messages has employed a
technique where the log message was one string and the pattern
(regular expression or radix tree based pattern) was executed
against it. To match patterns against logs which contain structured
data (such as the Windows EventLog), this structured data (the fields
of the log) must be converted to a single string. This is a simple but
inefficient method used by many tools.

The {productName} patterns defined in the XML pattern database file
can contain more than one field. This allows multi-dimensional pattern
matching. Thus with {productName}'s _pm_pattern_ module there is no need
to convert all fields into a single string as it can work with
multiple fields.

Patterns can be grouped together under pattern groups. Pattern groups
serve an optimization purpose. The group can have an optional
_matchfield_ block which can check a condition. If the condition (such
as `$SourceName` matches `sshd`) is satisfied, the _pm_pattern_ module
will descend into the group and check each pattern against the log. If
the pattern group's condition did not match (`$SourceName` was not
`sshd`), the module can skip all patterns in the group without having
to check each pattern individually.

When the _pm_pattern_ module finds a matching pattern, the `$PatternID`
and `$PatternName` fields are set on the log message. These can be
used later in conditional processing and correlation rules of the
<<pm_evcorr,pm_evcorr>> module, for example.

[NOTE]
====
The _pm_pattern_ module does not process all patterns. It exits after
the first matching pattern is found. This means that at most one
pattern can match a log message. Multiple patterns that can match the
same subset of logs should be avoided. For example, with two regular
expression patterns `^\d+` and `^\d\d`, the second may never be
matched because of the first. The internal order of patterns and
pattern groups is changed dynamically by _pm_pattern_. Patterns with the
highest match count are placed and tried first. In addition to
performance optimization, setting the value of `$PatternID` would be
problematic with multiple values because the language does not support
arrays.

For a strictly linearly executing pattern matcher, see the
<<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive.

[[pm_pattern_config]]
===== Configuration

The _pm_pattern_ module accepts the following directives in addition to
the <<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[pm_pattern_config_patternfile]]
PatternFile:: This mandatory directive specifies the name of the
  <<pm_pattern_patterndb,pattern database file>>.

===== Examples

.Using the pm_pattern Module
====
This configuration reads BSD Syslog messages from the socket,
processes the messages with a pattern file, and then writes them to
file in JSON format.

The following pattern database contains two patterns to match SSH
authentication messages. The patterns are under a group named _ssh_
which checks whether the `$SourceName` field is `sshd` and only tries
to match the patterns if the logs are indeed from sshd. The patterns
both extract _AuthMethod_, _AccountName_, and _SourceIP4Address_ from
the log message when the pattern matches the log. Additionally
_TaxonomyStatus_ and _TaxonomyAction_ are set. The second pattern
utilizes the <<config_module_exec,Exec>> block, which is evaluated
when the pattern matches.

NOTE: For this pattern to work, the logs must be parsed with
      <<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog,parse_syslog()>> prior to
      processing by the _pm_pattern_ module (as in the above example),
      because it uses the
      `$SourceName` and `$Message` fields.
