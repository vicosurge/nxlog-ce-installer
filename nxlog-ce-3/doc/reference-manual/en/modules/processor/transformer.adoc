[desc="Converts between various event formats"]
==== Format Converter (pm_transformer)

The _pm_transformer_ module provides parsers for BSD Syslog, IETF
Syslog, CSV, JSON, and XML formatted data and can also convert
between. This module is now obsoleted by the functions and procedures
provided by the following modules: <<xm_syslog,xm_syslog>>,
<<xm_csv,xm_csv>>, <<xm_json,xm_json>>, and <<xm_xml,xm_xml>>. Using
this module can be slightly faster than calling these procedures from
an <<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive.

[[pm_transformer_config]]
===== Configuration

The _pm_transformer_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>. For conversion to occur,
the <<pm_transformer_config_inputformat,InputFormat>> and
<<pm_transformer_config_outputformat,OutputFormat>> directives must be
specified.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat]]
InputFormat:: This directive specifies the input format of the
  `$raw_event` field so that it is further parsed into fields. If this
  directive is not specified, no parsing will be performed.
+
--
[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_csv]]
CSV::: Input is parsed as a comma-separated list of values. See
  <<xm_csv,xm_csv>> for similar functionality. The input fields must be
  defined by <<pm_transformer_config_csvinputfields,CSVInputFields>>.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_json]]
JSON::: Input is parsed as JSON. This does the same as the
  <<xm_json_proc_parse_json,parse_json()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_bsd]]
syslog_bsd::: Same as
  <<pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_rfc3164,syslog_rfc3164>>.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_ietf]]
syslog_ietf::: Same as
  <<pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_rfc5424,syslog_rfc5424>>.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_rfc3164]]
syslog_rfc3164::: Input is parsed in the BSD Syslog format as defined by
  RFC 3164. This does the same as the
  <<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_bsd,parse_syslog_bsd()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_syslog_rfc5424]]
syslog_rfc5424::: Input is parsed in the IETF Syslog format as defined by
  RFC 5424. This does the same as the
  <<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_ietf,parse_syslog_ietf()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_inputformat_xml]]
XML::: Input is parsed as XML. This does the same as the
  <<xm_xml_proc_parse_xml,parse_xml()>> procedure.
--

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat]]
OutputFormat:: This directive specifies the output transformation. If
  this directive is not specified, fields are not converted and
  `$raw_event` is left unmodified.
+
--
[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_csv]]
CSV::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted as a comma-separated list of
  values. See <<xm_csv,xm_csv>> for similar functionality.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_json]]
JSON::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted as JSON. This does the same as the
  <<xm_json_proc_to_json,to_json()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_bsd]]
syslog_bsd::: Same as
  <<pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_rfc3164,syslog_rfc3164>>.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_ietf]]
syslog_ietf::: Same as
  <<pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_rfc5424,syslog_rfc5424>>.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_rfc3164]]
syslog_rfc3164::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted in the BSD Syslog format
  as defined by RFC 3164. This does the same as the
  <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_bsd,to_syslog_bsd()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_rfc5424]]
syslog_rfc5424::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted in the IETF Syslog
  format as defined by RFC 5424. This does the same as the
  <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_ietf,to_syslog_ietf()>> procedure.

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_syslog_snare]]
syslog_snare::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted in the SNARE Syslog
  format. This does the same as the
  <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_snare,to_syslog_snare()>> procedure. This should
  be used in conjunction with the <<im_mseventlog,im_mseventlog>> or
  <<im_msvistalog,im_msvistalog>> module to produce an output compatible with
  https://www.intersectalliance.com/our-product/snare-agent/operating-system-agents/snare-agent-for-windows/[Snare
  Agent for Windows].

[[pm_transformer_config_outputformat_xml]]
XML::: Output in `$raw_event` is formatted in XML. This does the same as the
  <<xm_xml_proc_to_xml,to_xml()>> procedure.
--

'''

[[pm_transformer_config_csvinputfields]]
CSVInputFields:: This is a comma-separated list of fields which will
  be set from the input parsed. The field names must have the dollar
  sign (`$`) prepended.

[[pm_transformer_config_csvinputfieldtypes]]
CSVInputFieldTypes:: This optional directive specifies the list of
  types corresponding to the field names defined in
  <<pm_transformer_config_csvinputfields,CSVInputFields>>. If
  specified, the number of types must match the number of field names
  specified with
  <<pm_transformer_config_csvinputfields,CSVInputFields>>. If this
  directive is omitted, all fields will be stored as
  <<lang_type_string,strings>>. This directive has no effect on the
  fields-to-CSV conversion.

[[pm_transformer_config_csvoutputfields]]
CSVOutputFields:: This is a comma-separated list of message fields
  which are placed in the CSV lines. The field names must have the
  dollar sign (`$`) prepended.

This configuration reads BSD Syslog messages from file and writes them
to another file in CSV format.
