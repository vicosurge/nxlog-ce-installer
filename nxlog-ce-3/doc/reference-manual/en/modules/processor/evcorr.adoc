[desc="Provides conditional execution based on correlation between events"]
==== Event Correlator (pm_evcorr)

The _pm_evcorr_ module provides event correlation functionality in
addition to the already available {productName} language features such
as <<lang_variables,variables>> and <<lang_stat,statistical counters>>
which can be also used for event correlation purposes.

This module was greatly inspired by the Perl based correlation tool
http://simple-evcorr.github.io/[SEC]. Some of the rules of the
_pm_evcorr_ module were designed to mimic those available in SEC. This
module aims to be a better alternative to SEC with the following
advantages:

* The correlation rules in SEC work with the current time. With
  _pm_evcorr_ it is possible to specify a time field which is used for
  elapsed time calculation making offline event correlation possible.
* SEC uses regular expressions extensively, which can become quite
  slow if there are many correlation rules. In contrast, this module
  can correlate pre-processed messages using fields from, for example,
  the <<pm_pattern,pattern matcher>> and <<xm_syslog,Syslog>> parsers
  without requiring the use of regular expressions (though these are
  also available for use by correlation rules). Thus testing
  conditions can be significantly faster when simple comparison is
  used instead of regular expression based pattern matching.
* This module was designed to operate on fields, making it possible to
  correlate structured logs in addition to simple free-form log
  messages.
* Most importantly, this module is written in C, providing performance
  benefits (where SEC is written in pure Perl).

The rulesets of this module can use a context. A context is an
expression which is evaluated during runtime to a value and the
correlation rule is checked in the context of this value. For example,
to count the number of failed logins per user and alert if the failed
logins exceed 3 for the user, the `$AccountName` would be used as the
context. There is a separate context storage for each correlation rule
instance. For global contexts accessible from all rule instances, see
<<lang_variables,module variables>> and <<lang_stat,statistical
counters>>.

[[pm_evcorr_config]]
===== Configuration

The _pm_evcorr_ module accepts the following directives in addition to
the <<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

The _pm_evcorr_ configuration contains correlation rules which are evaluated for
each log message processed by the module. Currently there are five rule types
supported by pm_evcorr: <<pm_evcorr_config_absence,Absence>>,
<<pm_evcorr_config_pair,Pair>>, <<pm_evcorr_config_simple,Simple>>,
<<pm_evcorr_config_suppressed,Suppressed>>, and
<<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded,Thresholded>>. These rules are defined in
configuration blocks. The rules are evaluated in the order they are
defined. For example, a correlation rule can change a state, variable, or
field which can be then used by a later rule. <<config_general_include,File
inclusion>> can be useful to store correlation rules in a separate file.

[[pm_evcorr_config_absence]]
Absence:: This rule type does the opposite of
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair,Pair>>. When
  <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_triggercondition,TriggerCondition>>
  evaluates to TRUE, this rule type will wait
  <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_interval,Interval>> seconds for
  <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_requiredcondition,RequiredCondition>> to
  become TRUE. If it does not become TRUE, it executes the
  statement(s) in the <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_exec,Exec>>
  directive(s).
+
--
[[pm_evcorr_config_absence_context]]
Context::: This optional directive specifies an expression to be used as the
  context. It must evaluate to a value. Usually a field is specified here.

[[pm_evcorr_config_absence_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives must be specified, each taking a
  <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument.
+
NOTE: The evaluation of this Exec is not triggered by a log event; thus it
      does not make sense to use log data related operations such as accessing
      fields.

[[pm_evcorr_config_absence_interval]]
Interval::: This mandatory directive takes an integer argument specifying the
  number of seconds to wait for
  <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_requiredcondition,RequiredCondition>> to become
  TRUE. Its value must be greater than 0. The
  <<pm_evcorr_config_timefield,TimeField>> directive is used to calculate
  time.

[[pm_evcorr_config_absence_requiredcondition]]
RequiredCondition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument
  which must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value. When this
  evaluates to TRUE after
  <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_triggercondition,TriggerCondition>> evaluated to
  TRUE within <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_interval,Interval>> seconds, the
  statement(s) in the <<pm_evcorr_config_absence_exec,Exec>> directive(s) are
  NOT executed.

[[pm_evcorr_config_absence_triggercondition]]
TriggerCondition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument
  which must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value.
--

[[pm_evcorr_config_pair]]
Pair:: When
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_triggercondition,TriggerCondition>>
  evaluates to TRUE, this rule type will wait
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_interval,Interval>> seconds for
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_requiredcondition,RequiredCondition>> to
  become TRUE. It then executes the statement(s) in the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_exec,Exec>> directive(s).
+
--
[[pm_evcorr_config_pair_context]]
Context::: This optional directive specifies an expression to be used as the
  context. It must evaluate to a value. Usually a field is specified here.

[[pm_evcorr_config_pair_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives must be specified, each taking a
  <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument.

[[pm_evcorr_config_pair_interval]]
Interval::: This directive takes an integer argument specifying the number of
  seconds to wait for
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_requiredcondition,RequiredCondition>> to become
  TRUE. If this directive is `0` or not specified, the rule will wait
  indefinitely for
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_requiredcondition,RequiredCondition>> to become
  TRUE. The <<pm_evcorr_config_timefield,TimeField>> directive is used to
  calculate time.

[[pm_evcorr_config_pair_requiredcondition]]
RequiredCondition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument
  which must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value. When this
  evaluates to TRUE after
  <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_triggercondition,TriggerCondition>> evaluated to
  TRUE within <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_interval,Interval>> seconds, the
  statement(s) in the <<pm_evcorr_config_pair_exec,Exec>> directive(s) are
  executed.

[[pm_evcorr_config_pair_triggercondition]]
TriggerCondition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument
  which must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value.
--

[[pm_evcorr_config_simple]]
Simple:: This rule type is essentially the same as the
  <<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive supported by all
  modules. Because <<config_module_exec,Exec>>s are evaluated before
  the correlation rules, the *Simple* rule was also needed to be able
  to evaluate a statement as the other rules do, following the rule
  order. The *Simple* block has one directive also with the same name.
+
[[pm_evcorr_config_simple_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives must be specified, with a
  <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument.

[[pm_evcorr_config_stop]]
Stop:: This rule will stop evaluating successive rules if the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_stop_condition,Condition>> evaluates to TRUE. The
  optional <<pm_evcorr_config_stop_exec,Exec>> directive will be
  evaluated in this case.
+
--
[[pm_evcorr_config_stop_condition]]
Condition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument which
  must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value. When it evaluates to
  TRUE, the correlation rule engine will stop checking any further rules.

[[pm_evcorr_config_stop_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives may be specified, each taking a
  <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument. This will be evaluated when the
  specified <<pm_evcorr_config_stop_condition,Condition>> is satisfied. This
  directive is optional.
--

[[pm_evcorr_config_suppressed]]
Suppressed:: This rule type matches the given condition. If the
  condition evaluates to TRUE, the statement specified with the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_exec,Exec>> directive is
  evaluated. The rule will then ignore any log messages for the time
  specified with <<pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_interval,Interval>>
  directive. This rule is useful for avoiding creating multiple alerts
  in a short period when a condition is satisfied.
+
--
[[pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_condition]]
Condition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument which
  must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value.

[[pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_context]]
Context::: This optional directive specifies an expression to be used as the
  context. It must evaluate to a value. Usually a field is specified here.

[[pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives must be specified, each taking
  a <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument.

[[pm_evcorr_config_suppressed_interval]]
Interval::: This mandatory directive takes an integer argument specifying the
  number of seconds to ignore the condition. The
  <<pm_evcorr_config_timefield,TimeField>> directive is used to calculate
  time.
--

[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded]]
Thresholded:: This rule type will execute the statement(s) in the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_exec,Exec>> directive(s) if the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_condition,Condition>> evaluates to
  TRUE <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_threshold,Threshold>> or more
  times during the <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_interval,Interval>>
  specified. The advantage of this rule over the use of
  <<lang_stat,statistical counters>> is that the time window is
  dynamic and shifts as log messages are processed.
+
--
[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_condition]]
Condition::: This mandatory directive takes an expression as argument which
  must evaluate to a <<lang_type_boolean,boolean>> value.

[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_context]]
Context::: This optional directive specifies an expression to be used as the
  context. It must evaluate to a value. Usually a field is specified here.

[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_exec]]
Exec::: One or more *Exec* directives must be specified, each taking
  a <<lang_statements,statement>> as argument.

[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_interval]]
Interval::: This mandatory directive takes an integer argument specifying a
  time window for <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_condition,Condition>> to
  become TRUE. Its value must be greater than 0. The
  <<pm_evcorr_config_timefield,TimeField>> directive is used to calculate
  time. This time window is dynamic, meaning that it will shift.

[[pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_threshold]]
Threshold::: This mandatory directive takes an integer argument specifying the
  number of times <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_condition,Condition>> must
  evaluate to TRUE within the given time
  <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_interval,Interval>>. When the threshold is
  reached, the module executes the statement(s) in the
  <<pm_evcorr_config_thresholded_exec,Exec>> directive(s).
--

'''

[[pm_evcorr_config_contextcleantime]]
ContextCleanTime:: When a Context is used in the correlation rules,
  these must be purged from memory after they are expired, otherwise
  using too many context values could result in a high memory
  usage. This optional directive specifies the interval between
  context cleanups, in seconds. By default a `60` second cleanup
  interval is used if any rules use a Context and this directive is
  not specified.

[[pm_evcorr_config_timefield]]
TimeField:: This specifies the name of the <<lang_fields,field>> to
  use for calculating elapsed time, such as `EventTime`. The name of
  the field must be specified without the leading dollar sign
  (`$`). If this parameter is not specified, the current time is
  assumed. This directive makes it possible to accurately correlate
  events based on the event time recorded in the logs and to do
  non-real-time event correlation.
