[desc="Parses and generates data formatted as key-value pairs"]
==== Key-Value Pairs (xm_kvp)

This module provides functions and procedures for processing data
formatted as key-value pairs (KVPs), also commonly called "name-value
pairs". The module can both parse and generate key-value formatted
data.

It is quite common to have a different set of keys in each log line
when accepting key-value formatted input messages. Extracting values
from such logs using regular expressions can be quite cumbersome. The
_xm_kvp_ extension module automates this process.

Log messages containing key-value pairs typically look like one the
following:

* `key1: value1, key2: value2, key42: value42`
* `key1="value 1"; key2="value 2"`
* `Application=smtp, Event='Protocol Conversation', status='Client
  Request', ClientRequest='HELO 1.2.3.4'`

Keys are usually separated from the value using an equal sign (`=`) or
a colon (`:`); and the key-value pairs are delimited with a comma
(`,`), a semicolon (`;`), or a space. In addition, values and keys may
be quoted and may contain escaping. The module will try to guess the
format, or the format can be explicitly specified using the
configuration directives below.

NOTE: It is possible to use more than one _xm_kvp_ module instance with
      different options in order to support different KVP formats at
      the same time. For this reason, functions and procedures
      exported by the module are public and must be referenced by the
      module instance name.

[[xm_kvp_config]]
===== Configuration

The _xm_kvp_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[xm_kvp_config_detectnumericvalues]]
DetectNumericValues:: If this optional boolean directive is set to TRUE,
the <<xm_kvp_proc_parse_kvp,parse_kvp()>> procedure will try to
parse numeric values as integers first. The default is TRUE (numeric
values will be parsed as integers and unquoted in the output). Note that
floating-point numbers will not be handled.

[[xm_kvp_config_escapechar]]
EscapeChar:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. It specifies the
  character used for escaping special characters. The escape character
  is used to prefix the following characters: the *EscapeChar* itself,
  the <<xm_kvp_config_keyquotechar,KeyQuoteChar>>, and the
  <<xm_kvp_config_valuequotechar,ValueQuoteChar>>. If
  <<xm_kvp_config_escapecontrol,EscapeControl>> is TRUE, the newline
  (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), tab (`\t`), and backspace (`\b`)
  control characters are also escaped. The default escape character is
  the backslash (`\`).

[[xm_kvp_config_escapecontrol]]
EscapeControl:: If this optional boolean directive is set to TRUE,
  control characters are also escaped. See the
  <<xm_kvp_config_escapechar,EscapeChar>> directive for details. The
  default is TRUE (control characters are escaped). Note that this is
  necessary in order to support single-line KVP field lists containing
  line-breaks.

[[xm_kvp_config_includehiddenfields]]
IncludeHiddenFields:: This boolean directive specifies that the
<<xm_kvp_func_to_kvp,to_kvp()>> function or the
 <<xm_kvp_proc_to_kvp,to_kvp()>> procedure should inlude fields
having a leading dot (`.`) or underscore (`_`) in their names.
The default is TRUE. If *IncludeHiddenFields* is set to TRUE, then
generated text will contain these otherwise excluded fields.

[[xm_kvp_config_keyquotechar]]
KeyQuoteChar:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. It specifies the
  quote character for enclosing key names. If this directive is not
  specified, the module will accept single-quoted keys, double-quoted
  keys, and unquoted keys.

[[xm_kvp_config_kvdelimiter]]
KVDelimiter:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. It specifies the
  delimiter character used to separate the key from the value. If this
  directive is not set and the <<xm_kvp_proc_parse_kvp,parse_kvp()>>
  procedure is used, the module will try to guess the delimiter from
  the following: the colon (`:`) or the equal-sign (`=`).

[[xm_kvp_config_quotemethod]]
QuoteMethod:: This directive can be used to specify the quote method
  used for the values by <<xm_kvp_proc_to_kvp,to_kvp()>>.
+
[[xm_kvp_config_quotemethod_all]]
  All:::
    The values will be always quoted. This is the default.
+
[[xm_kvp_config_quotemethod_delimiter]]
  Delimiter:::
    The value will be only enclosed in quotes if it contains the
    delimiter character.
+
[[xm_kvp_config_quotemethod_none]]
  None:::
    The values will not be quoted.

[[xm_kvp_config_kvpdelimiter]]
KVPDelimiter:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. It specifies the
  delimiter character used to separate the key-value pairs. If this
  directive is not set and the <<xm_kvp_proc_parse_kvp,parse_kvp()>>
  procedure is used, the module will try to guess the delimiter from
  the following: the comma (`,`), the semicolon (`;`), or the space.

[[xm_kvp_config_valuequotechar]]
ValueQuoteChar:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. It specifies the
  quote character for enclosing key values. If this directive is not
  specified, the module will accept single-quoted values,
  double-quoted values, and unquoted values. Normally, quotation is
  used when the value contains a space or the
  <<xm_kvp_config_kvdelimiter,KVDelimiter>> character.

[[xm_kvp_config_char]]
====== Specifying Quote, Escape, and Delimiter Characters

The <<xm_kvp_config_keyquotechar,KeyQuoteChar>>,
<<xm_kvp_config_valuequotechar,ValueQuoteChar>>,
<<xm_kvp_config_escapechar,EscapeChar>>,
<<xm_kvp_config_kvdelimiter,KVDelimiter>>, and
<<xm_kvp_config_kvpdelimiter,KVPDelimiter>> directives can be
specified in several ways.

[[xm_kvp_config_examples]]
===== Examples

The following examples illustrate various scenarios for parsing KVPs,
whether embedded, encapsulated (in Syslog, for example), or alone. In
each case, the logs are converted from KVP input files to JSON output
files, though obviously there are many other possibilities.

[[xm_kvp_example_simple]]
.Simple KVP Parsing
====
The following two lines of input are in a simple KVP format where each
line consists of various keys with values assigned to them.

.Input Sample
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/xm_kvp5.in[]
----

This input can be parsed with the following configuration. The parsed
fields can be used in {productName} expressions: a new field named
`$Overweight` is added and set to TRUE if the conditions
are met. Finally a few automatically added fields are removed, and the
log is then converted to JSON.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../../../config-examples/xm_kvp5.conf[lines=2..-1]
----

.Output Sample
[source,json]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/xm_kvp5.out[]
----
====

[[xm_kvp_example_cisco_acs]]
.Parsing KVPs in Cisco ACS Syslog
====
The following lines are from a Cisco ACS source.

.Input Sample
[source,log]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/cisco_acs.in[]
----

These logs are in Syslog format with a set of values present in each
record and an additional set of KVPs. The following configuration can
be used to process this and convert it to JSON.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../../../config-examples/cisco_acs.conf[lines=2..-1]
----

.Output Sample
[source,json]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/cisco_acs.out[]
----
====

[[xm_kvp_example_sidewinder]]
.Parsing KVPs in Sidewinder Logs
====
The following line is from a Sidewinder log source.

.Input Sample
[source,log]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/sidewinder.in[]
----

This can be parsed and converted to JSON with the following
configuration.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../../../config-examples/sidewinder.conf[lines=2..-1]
----

.Output Sample
[source,json]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/sidewinder.out[]
----
====

[[xm_kvp_example_apache_url]]
.Parsing URL Request Parameters in Apache Access Logs
====
URLs in HTTP requests frequently contain URL parameters which are a
special kind of key-value pairs delimited by the ampersand (`&`). Here
is an example of two HTTP requests logged by the Apache web server in
the Combined Log Format.

.Input Sample
[source,log]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/apache_url.in[]
----

The following configuration file parses the access log and extracts
all the fields. The request parameters are extracted into the
$HTTPParams field using a regular expression, and then this field is
further parsed using the KVP parser. At the end of the processing all
fields are converted to KVP format using the
<<xm_kvp_proc_to_kvp,to_kvp()>> procedure of the _kvp2_ instance.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../../../config-examples/apache_url.conf[lines=2..-1]
----

The two request parameters _action_ and _obj_id_ then appear at the end
of the KVP formatted lines.

.Output Sample
[source,log]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/kvp/apache_url.out[]
----

NOTE: URL escaping is not handled.
