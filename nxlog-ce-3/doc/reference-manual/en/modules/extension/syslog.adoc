==== Syslog (xm_syslog)

This module provides support for the legacy BSD Syslog protocol as
defined in RFC 3164 and the current IETF standard defined by RFCs
5424-5426. This is achieved by exporting functions and procedures
usable from the {productName} language. The transport is handled by
the respective input and output modules (such as <<im_udp,im_udp>>),
this module only provides a parser and helper functions to create
Syslog messages and handle facility and severity values.

The older but still widespread BSD Syslog standard defines both the
format and the transport protocol in RFC 3164. The transport protocol
is UDP, but to provide reliability and security, this line-based
format is also commonly transferred over TCP and SSL. There is a newer
standard defined in RFC 5424, also known as the IETF Syslog format,
which obsoletes the BSD Syslog format. This format overcomes most of
the limitations of BSD Syslog and allows multi-line messages and
proper timestamps. The transport method is defined in RFC 5426 for UDP
and RFC 5425 for TLS/SSL.

Because the IETF Syslog format supports multi-line messages, RFC 5425
defines a special format to encapsulate these by prepending the
payload size in ASCII to the IETF Syslog message. Messages transferred
in UDP packets are self-contained and do not need this additional
framing. The following input reader and output writer functions are
provided by the _xm_syslog_ module to support this TLS transport defined
in RFC 5425.  While RFC 5425 explicitly defines that the TLS network
transport protocol is to be used, pure TCP may be used if security is
not a requirement. Syslog messages can also be written to file with
this framing format using these functions.

[[xm_syslog_inputtype_syslog_tls]]
InputType Syslog_TLS:: This input reader function parses the payload
  size and then reads the message according to this value. It is
  required to support Syslog TLS transport defined in RFC 5425.

[[xm_syslog_outputtype_syslog_tls]]
OutputType Syslog_TLS:: This output writer function prepends the
  payload size to the message. It is required to support Syslog TLS
  transport defined in RFC 5425.

NOTE: The _Syslog_TLS_ InputType/OutputType can work with any
      input/output such as <<im_tcp,im_tcp>> or <<im_file,im_file>>
      and does not depend on SSL transport at all. The name
      _Syslog_TLS_ was chosen to refer to the octet-framing method
      described in RFC 5425 used for TLS transport.

NOTE: The <<pm_transformer,pm_transformer>> module can also parse and
      create BSD and IETF Syslog messages, but the functions and
      procedures provided by this module make it possible to solve
      more complex tasks which <<pm_transformer,pm_transformer>> is
      not capable of on its own.

Structured data in IETF Syslog messages is parsed and put into
{productName} fields. The SD-ID will be prepended to the field name
with a dot unless it is `NXLOG@XXXX`. Consider the following Syslog
message:

[source,log]
----
<30>1 2011-12-04T21:16:10.000000+02:00 host app procid msgid [exampleSDID@32473 eventSource="Application" eventID="1011"] Message part
----

After this IETF-formatted Syslog message is parsed with
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_ietf,parse_syslog_ietf()>>, there will
be two additional fields: `$exampleSDID.eventID` and
`$exampleSDID.eventSource`. When SD-ID is `NXLOG`, the field name will
be the same as the SD-PARAM name. The two additional fields extracted
from the structured data part of the following IETF Syslog message are
`$eventID` and `$eventSource`:

[source,log]
----
<30>1 2011-12-04T21:16:10.000000+02:00 host app procid msgid [NXLOG@32473 eventSource="Application" eventID="1011"] Message part
----

All fields in the structured data part are parsed as
<<lang_type_string,strings>>.

[[xm_syslog_config]]
===== Configuration

The _xm_syslog_ module accepts the following directives in addition to
the <<config_module_common,common module directives>>.

[[xm_syslog_config_ietftimestampingmt]]
IETFTimestampInGMT:: This optional boolean directive can be used to
  format the timestamps produced by
  <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_ietf,to_syslog_ietf()>> in UTC/GMT
  instead of local time. The default is FALSE: local time is used with
  a timezone indicator.

[[xm_syslog_config_snaredelimiter]]
SnareDelimiter:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. This character is used
  by the <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_snare,to_syslog_snare()>>
  procedure to separate fields. If this directive is not specified,
  the default escape character is the tab (`\t`). In latter versions
  of Snare 4 this has changed to the hash mark (`#`); this directive
  can be used to specify the alternative delimiter. Note that there is
  no delimiter after the last field.

[[xm_syslog_config_snarereplacement]]
SnareReplacement:: This optional directive takes a single character
  (see <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument. This character is
  used by the <<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_snare,to_syslog_snare()>>
  procedure to replace occurrences of the
  <<xm_syslog_config_snaredelimiter,delimiter>> character inside the
  `$Message` field. If this directive is not specified, the default
  replacement character is the space.

[[xm_syslog_config_char]]
====== Specifying Quote, Escape, and Delimiter Characters

The <<xm_syslog_config_snaredelimiter,SnareDelimiter>> and
<<xm_syslog_config_snarereplacement,SnareReplacement>> directives can
be specified in several ways.

===== Examples

[[xm_syslog_example_syslog_bsd_file]]
.Sending a File as BSD Syslog over UDP
====
In this example, logs are collected from files, converted to BSD
Syslog format with the
<<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_bsd,to_syslog_bsd()>> procedure, and sent
over UDP with the <<om_udp,om_udp>> module.

.Collecting BSD Style Syslog Messages over UDP
====
To collect BSD Syslog messages over UDP, use the
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_bsd,parse_syslog_bsd()>> procedure
coupled with the <<im_udp,im_udp>> module as in the following example.

[[xm_syslog_example_ietf_udp]]
.Collecting IETF Style Syslog Messages over UDP
====
To collect IETF Syslog messages over UDP as defined by RFC 5424 and
RFC 5426, use the
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_ietf,parse_syslog_ietf()>> procedure
coupled with the <<im_udp,im_udp>> module as in the following example.
Note that, as for BSD Syslog, the default port is 514 (as defined by
RFC 5426).

[[xm_syslog_example_bsd_ietf_udp]]
.Collecting Both IETF and BSD Syslog Messages over the Same UDP Port
====
To collect both IETF and BSD Syslog messages over UDP, use the
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog,parse_syslog()>> procedure coupled with
the <<im_udp,im_udp>> module as in the following example. This
procedure is capable of detecting and parsing both Syslog
formats. Since 514 is the default UDP port number for both BSD and
IETF Syslog, this port can be useful to collect both formats
simultaneously. To accept both formats on different ports, the
appropriate parsers can be used as in the previous two examples.

.Collecting IETF Syslog Messages over TLS/SSL
====
To collect IETF Syslog messages over TLS/SSL as defined by RFC 5424
and RFC 5425, use the
<<xm_syslog_proc_parse_syslog_ietf,parse_syslog_ietf()>> procedure
coupled with the <<im_ssl,im_ssl>> module as in this example.  Note
that the default port is 6514 in this case (as defined by RFC
5425). The payload format parser is handled by the
<<xm_syslog_inputtype_syslog_tls,Syslog_TLS>> input reader.

[[xm_syslog_example_ietf_tcpout]]
.Forwarding IETF Syslog over TCP
====
The following configuration uses the
<<xm_syslog_proc_to_syslog_ietf,to_syslog_ietf()>> procedure to
convert input to IETF Syslog and forward it over TCP.

.nxlog.conf
[source,config]
----
include::../../../config-examples/xm_syslog_ietf_tcpout.conf[lines=2..-1]
----

Because of the Syslog_TLS framing, the raw data sent over TCP will
look like the following.

.Output Sample
[source,log]
----
130 <13>1 2012-01-01T16:15:52.873750Z  - - - [NXLOG@14506 EventReceivedTime="2012-01-01 17:15:52" TestField="test value"] test message
----

This example shows that all fields--except those which are filled by
the Syslog parser--are added to the structured data part.

[[xm_syslog_example1]]
.Conditional Rewrite of the Syslog Facility--Version 1
====
If the message part of the Syslog event matches the regular
expression, the `$SeverityValue` field will be set to the "error"
Syslog severity integer value (which is provided by the
<<xm_syslog_func_syslog_severity_value,syslog_severity_value()>>
function).

====

[[xm_syslog_example2]]
.Conditional Rewrite of the Syslog Facility--Version 2
====
The following example does almost the same thing as the previous
example, except that the Syslog parsing and rewrite is moved to a
processor module and the rewrite only occurs if the facility was
modified.  This can make processing faster on multi-core systems
because the processor module runs in a separate thread. This method
can also minimize UDP packet loss because the input module does not
need to parse Syslog messages and therefore can process UDP packets
faster.
