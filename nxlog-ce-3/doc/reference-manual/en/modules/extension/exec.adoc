[desc="Supports execution of a program or script during processing"]
==== External Programs (xm_exec)

This module provides two procedures which make it possible to execute
external scripts or programs. These two procedures are provided
through this extension module in order to keep the {productName} core
small. Also, without this module loaded an administrator is not able
to execute arbitrary scripts.

NOTE: The <<im_exec,im_exec>> and <<om_exec,om_exec>> modules also
      provide support for running external programs, though the
      purpose of these is to pipe data to and read data from
      programs. The procedures provided by the _xm_exec_ module do not
      pipe log message data, but are intended for multiple invocations
      (though data can be still passed to the executed script/program
      as command line arguments).
