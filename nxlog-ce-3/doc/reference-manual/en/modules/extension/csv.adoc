[desc="Parses and generates comma- and delimiter-separated data"]
==== Delimiter-Separated Values (xm_csv)

This module provides functions and procedures for working with data
formatted as comma-separated values (CSV). CSV input can be parsed
into <<lang_fields,fields>> and CSV output can be generated.
Delimiters other than the comma can be used also.

The <<pm_transformer,pm_transformer>> module provides a simple
interface to parse and generate CSV format, but the _xm_csv_ module
exports an API that can be used to solve more complex tasks involving
CSV formatted data.

NOTE: It is possible to use more than one _xm_csv_ module instance with
      different options in order to support different CSV formats at
      the same time. For this reason, functions and procedures
      exported by the module are public and must be referenced by the
      module instance name.

[[xm_csv_config]]
===== Configuration

The _xm_csv_ module accepts the following directives in addition to the
<<config_module_common,common module directives>>. The
<<xm_csv_config_fields,Fields>> directive is required.

[[xm_csv_config_fields]]
Fields:: This mandatory directive accepts a comma-separated list of
  fields which will be filled from the input parsed. Field names with
  or without the dollar sign (`$`) are accepted. The fields will be
  stored as <<lang_type_string,strings>> unless their types are
  explicitly specified with the
  <<xm_csv_config_fieldtypes,FieldTypes>> directive.

'''

[[xm_csv_config_delimiter]]
Delimiter:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument to specify the
  delimiter character used to separate fields. The default delimiter
  character is the comma (`,`). Note that there is no delimiter after
  the last field.

[[xm_csv_config_escapechar]]
EscapeChar:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument to specify the escape
  character used to escape special characters. The escape character is
  used to prefix the following characters: the escape character
  itself, the <<xm_csv_config_quotechar,quote character>>, and the
  <<xm_csv_config_delimiter,delimiter character>>. If
  <<xm_csv_config_escapecontrol,EscapeControl>> is TRUE, the newline
  (`\n`), carriage return (`\r`), tab (`\t`), and backspace (`\b`)
  control characters are also escaped. The default escape character is
  the backslash character (`\`).

[[xm_csv_config_escapecontrol]]
EscapeControl:: If this optional boolean directive is set to TRUE,
  control characters are also escaped. See the
  <<xm_csv_config_escapechar,EscapeChar>> directive for details. The
  default is TRUE: control characters are escaped. Note that this is
  necessary to allow single line CSV field lists which contain
  line-breaks.

[[xm_csv_config_fieldtypes]]
FieldTypes:: This optional directive specifies the list of types
  corresponding to the field names defined in
  <<xm_csv_config_fields,Fields>>. If specified, the number of types
  must match the number of field names specified with
  <<xm_csv_config_fields,Fields>>. If this directive is omitted, all
  fields will be stored as <<lang_type_string,strings>>. This
  directive has no effect on the fields-to-CSV conversion.

[[xm_csv_config_quotechar]]
QuoteChar:: This optional directive takes a single character (see
  <<{module}_config_char,below>>) as argument to specify the quote
  character used to enclose fields. If
  <<xm_csv_config_quoteoptional,QuoteOptional>> is TRUE, then only
  <<lang_type_string,string>> type fields are quoted. The default is
  the double-quote character (`"`).

[[xm_csv_config_quotemethod]]
QuoteMethod:: This optional directive can take the following values:
+
--
  All::: All fields will be quoted.
  None::: Nothing will be quoted. This can be problematic if a field
    value (typically text that can contain any character) contains the
    delimiter character. Make sure that this is escaped or replaced
    with something else.
  String::: Only <<lang_type_string,string>> type fields will be
    quoted. This has the same effect as
    <<xm_csv_config_quoteoptional,QuoteOptional>> set to TRUE and is
    the default behavior if the *QuoteMethod* directive is not
    specified.
--
+
Note that this directive only effects CSV generation when using
<<xm_csv_func_to_csv,to_csv()>>. The CSV parser can automatically
detect the quotation.

[[xm_csv_config_quoteoptional]]
QuoteOptional:: This directive has been deprecated in favor of
  <<xm_csv_config_quotemethod,QuoteMethod>>, which should be used
  instead.

[[xm_csv_config_undefvalue]]
UndefValue:: This optional directive specifies a string which will be
  treated as an undefined value. This is particularly useful when
  parsing the W3C format where the dash (`-`) marks an omitted field.

[[xm_csv_config_char]]
====== Specifying Quote, Escape, and Delimiter Characters

The <<xm_csv_config_quotechar,QuoteChar>>,
<<xm_csv_config_escapechar,EscapeChar>>, and
<<xm_csv_config_delimiter,Delimiter>> directives can be specified in
several ways.

.Complex CSV Format Conversion
====
This example shows that the _xm_csv_ module can not only parse and
create CSV formatted input and output, but with multiple _xm_csv_
modules it is also possible to reorder, add, remove, or modify fields
before outputting to a different CSV format.
