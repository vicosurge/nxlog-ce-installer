[desc="Parses log messages that span multiple lines"]
==== Multi-Line Parser (xm_multiline)

This module can be used for parsing log messages that span multiple lines. All
lines in an event are joined to form a single {productName} event record,
which can be further processed as required. Each multi-line event is detected
through some combination of header lines, footer lines, and fixed line counts,
as configured. The name of the _xm_multiline_ module instance is specified by
the input module's <<config_inputtype,InputType>> directive.

The module maintains a separate context for each input source, allowing
multi-line messages to be processed correctly even when coming from multiple
sources (specifically, multiple files or multiple network connections).

WARNING: UDP is treated as a single source and all logs are processed under
         the same context. It is therefore not recommended to use this module
         with <<im_udp,im_udp>> if messages will be received by multiple UDP
         senders (such as Syslog).

[[xm_multiline_config]]
===== Configuration

The _xm_multiline_ module accepts the following directives in addition
to the <<config_module_common,common module directives>>. One of
<<xm_multiline_config_fixedlinecount,FixedLineCount>> and
<<xm_multiline_config_headerline,HeaderLine>> must be specified.

[[xm_multiline_config_fixedlinecount]]
FixedLineCount:: This directive takes a positive integer number
  defining the number of lines to concatenate. This is useful
  when receiving log messages spanning a fixed number of lines. When this number
  is defined, the module knows where the event message ends and will
  not hold a message in the buffers until the next message arrives.

[[xm_multiline_config_headerline]]
HeaderLine:: This directive takes a <<lang_literal_string,string>> or
  a <<lang_regexp,regular expression>> literal. This will be matched
  against each line. When the match is successful, the successive
  lines are appended until the next header line is read. This
  directive is mandatory unless
  <<xm_multiline_config_fixedlinecount,FixedLineCount>> is used.
+
NOTE: Until a new message arrives with its associated header, the
      previous message is stored in the buffers because the module
      does not know where the message ends. The <<im_file,im_file>>
      module will forcibly flush this buffer after the configured
      <<im_file_config_pollinterval,PollInterval>> timeout. If this
      behavior is unacceptable,
      use an end marker with <<xm_multiline_config_endline,EndLine>>
      or switch to an encapsulation method (such as JSON).

'''

[[xm_multiline_config_endline]]
EndLine:: This is similar to the
  <<xm_multiline_config_headerline,HeaderLine>> directive. This
  optional directive also takes a <<lang_literal_string,string>> or a
  <<lang_regexp,regular expression>> literal to be matched against
  each line. When the match is successful the message is considered
  complete.

[[xm_multiline_config_exec]]
Exec:: This directive is almost identical to the behavior of the
  <<config_module_exec,Exec>> directive used by the other modules with
  the following differences:
+
--
* each line is passed in `$raw_event` as it is read, and the line
  terminator in included; and
* other fields cannot be used, and captured strings can not be stored
  as separate fields.
--
+
This is mostly useful for rewriting lines or filtering out certain
lines with the <<core_proc_drop,drop()>> procedure.

===== Examples

[[xm_multiline_example_5]]
.Parsing multi-line XML logs and converting to JSON
====
XML is commonly formatted as indented multi-line to make it more
readable. In the following configuration file the
<<xm_multiline_config_headerline,HeaderLine>> and
<<xm_multiline_config_endline,EndLine>> directives are used to parse
the events. The events are then converted to JSON after some timestamp
normalization.

[[xm_multiline_example_4]]
.Parsing DICOM Logs
====
Each log message has a header (TIMESTAMP INTEGER SEVERITY) which is
used as the message boundary. A regular expression is defined for this
with the <<xm_multiline_config_headerline,HeaderLine>> directive. Each
log message is prepended with an additional line containing dashes and
is written to a file.

[[xm_multiline_example_1]]
.Multi-line messages with a fixed string header
====
The following configuration will process messages having a fixed
string header containing dashes. Each event is then prepended with a
hash mark (`#`) and written to a file.

[[xm_multiline_example_2]]
.Multi-line messages with fixed line count
====
The following configuration will process messages having a fixed line
count of four. Lines containing only whitespace are ignored and
removed. Each event is then prepended with a hash mark (`#`) and
written to a file.

[[xm_multiline_example_3]]
.Multi-line messages with a Syslog header
====
Often, multi-line messages are logged over Syslog and each line is
processed as an event, with its own Syslog header. It is commonly
necessary to merge these back into a single event message.

.Input Sample
[source,log]
----
include::../../../../../test/modules/extension/multiline/xm_multiline3.in[]
----

The following configuration strips the Syslog header from the netstat
output stored in the traditional Syslog formatted file, and each
message is then printed again with a line of dashes used as a
separator.
