== NAME

nxlog - collects, processes, converts, and forwards event logs in many
different formats

== SYNOPSIS

*nxlog* [-c _conffile_] [-f]

*nxlog* [-c _conffile_] -v

*nxlog* [-r | -s]

== DESCRIPTION

NXLog can process high volumes of event logs from many different
sources. Supported types of log processing include rewriting, correlating,
alerting, filtering, and pattern matching. Additional features include
scheduling, log file rotation, buffering, and prioritized processing. After
processing, {productName} can store or forward event logs in any of many
supported formats. Inputs, outputs, and processing are implemented with a
modular architecture and a powerful configuration language.

// tag::linux_note[]

While the details provided here apply to {productName} installations on Linux
and other UNIX-style operating systems in particular, a few Windows-specific
notes are included.

// end::linux_note[]

== OPTIONS

*-c* _conffile_, *--conf* _conffile_:: Specify an alternate configuration file
  _conffile_. On Windows, this option must be used with *-f*. To change the
  configuration file used by the {productName} service on Windows, modify the
  service parameters.

*-f*, *--foreground*:: Run in foreground, do not daemonize.

*-h*, *--help*:: Print help.

*-r*, *--reload*:: Reload configuration of a running instance.

*-s*, *--stop*:: Send stop signal to a running instance.

*-v*, *--verify*:: Verify configuration file syntax.

== SIGNALS

Various signals can be used to control the {productName} process. Some
corresponding Windows control codes are also available; these are shown in
parentheses where applicable.

SIGHUP:: This signal causes {productName} to reload the configuration and
  restart the modules. On Windows, "sc stop nxlog" and "sc start nxlog" can be
  used instead.

SIGUSR1 (200):: This signal generates an internal log message with information
  about the current state of {productName} and its configured module
  instances. The message will be generated with INFO log level, written to the
  log file (if configured with <<config_global_logfile,LogFile>>), and
  available via the <<im_internal,im_internal>> module.

SIGUSR2 (201):: This signal causes {productName} to switch to the DEBUG log
  level. This is equivalent to setting the <<config_global_loglevel,LogLevel>>
  directive to `DEBUG` but does not require {productName} to be restarted.

SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGTERM:: {productName} will exit if it receives one of these
  signals. On Windows, "sc stop nxlog" can be used instead.

On Linux/UNIX, a signal can be sent with the `kill` command. The following,
for example, sends the SIGUSR1 signal:

`kill -SIGUSR1 $(cat /run/nxlog/nxlog.pid)`

On Windows, a signal can be sent with the `sc` command. The following, for
example, sends the 200 signal:

`sc control nxlog 200`

== FILES

*/bin/nxlog*:: The main {productName} executable

// tag::nxlog-stmnt-verifier[]

*/bin/nxlog-stmnt-verifier*:: This tool can be used to check
  {productName} Language statements. All statements are read from standard
  input and then validated. If a statement is invalid, the tool prints an
  error to standard error and exits non-zero.

// end::nxlog-stmnt-verifier[]

*/etc/nxlog.conf*:: The default configuration file

*/usr/libexec/nxlog/modules/*:: The {productName} modules are located in this
  directory, by default. See the <<config_global_moduledir,ModuleDir>>
  directive.

*/var/spool/nxlog/configcache.dat*:: This is the position cache file
  where positions are saved. See the <<config_global_nocache,NoCache>>
  directive, in addition to <<config_global_cachedir,CacheDir>>.

*/run/nxlog/nxlog.pid*:: The process ID (PID) of the currently
  running {productName} process is written to this file. See the
  <<config_global_pidfile,PidFile>> directive.
